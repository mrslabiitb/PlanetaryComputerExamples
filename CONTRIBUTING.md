# Planetary Computer Examples

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks that serve as examples of using the [Microsoft Planetary Computer](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com) data, APIs and Hub.

## Getting Started

This project uses Docker to encapsulate the development environment. To set up your development
environment, have Docker installed and run:

```sh
> scripts/setup
```

If you need to rebuild the images at any point, you
can run:

```sh
> scripts/update
```

To run the jupyter notebook server, you can use:

```sh
> scripts/server
```

And browse to the URL printed in the terminal output.

From there you'll be able to run all Jupyter Notebook examples. This also
runs a local webserver that can source notebook files to the Planetary
Computer docsite development environment. That project is preconfigured to
integrate with this server, so after running `./scripts/server` from within
this project, run `./scripts/update --devdocs` from the Planetary Computer
website project, and it will treat this local instance as the source for
external docs notebooks. See that projects ETL readme for more information.
